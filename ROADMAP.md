# miamcpdoc ROADMAP

## Vision Statement

miamcpdoc evolves from a documentation server into a **creative intelligence amplifier** - transforming static documentation access into dynamic knowledge generation that compounds creative capacity over time.

## Current Capabilities (v1.x)

### âœ… MCP Documentation Server
- **llms.txt Integration**: Seamless access to documentation sources via MCP protocol
- **Multi-Client Support**: Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop
- **Flexible Configuration**: YAML/JSON config files, direct URL specification
- **Domain Security**: Controlled access to trusted documentation sources
- **Local File Support**: Access to local documentation and knowledge files

### âœ… Specialized Documentation Servers
- **miamcpdoc-aisdk**: Vercel AI SDK documentation
- **miamcpdoc-huggingface**: Hugging Face ecosystem (Transformers, Diffusers, etc.)
- **miamcpdoc-langgraph**: LangGraph and LangChain documentation
- **miamcpdoc-llms**: Core LLM concepts and llms.txt standard
- **miamcpdoc-creative**: Creative frameworks (RISE, Narrative Remixing, etc.)

### âœ… Integration Architecture
- **HTTP/SSE Transport**: Web-accessible documentation servers
- **FastMCP Foundation**: Robust MCP server framework
- **Content Processing**: HTML â†’ Markdown conversion with redirect handling
- **Tool Integration**: `list_doc_sources` and `fetch_docs` MCP tools

## Next Major Evolution (v2.0+): Knowledge Graph Intelligence

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Vision: Structured Knowledge â†’ Dynamic Documentation

Transform from static llms.txt files to **living knowledge graphs** that generate contextual documentation on-demand.

#### Knowledge Graph Architecture
- **Entities**: Concepts, methods, frameworks, code patterns, insights
- **Relationships**: Dependencies, extensions, conflicts, creative applications
- **Context Metadata**: When to use, creative vs reactive orientations, evolution history
- **Temporal Tracking**: How knowledge builds and compounds over time

#### Dynamic Documentation Generation
- **Graph Query Engine**: Intelligent queries like "Show creative frameworks for trading automation"
- **Contextual llms.txt**: Generate documentation based on current creative intent
- **Personalized Knowledge**: Adapt content to user's project context and goals
- **Real-time Evolution**: Capture new insights and relationships during conversations

#### Creative Intelligence Amplification
- **Insight Capture**: Transform breakthrough conversations into structured knowledge
- **Relationship Discovery**: Automatically identify connections between concepts
- **Creative Pattern Recognition**: Surface creative approaches across domains
- **Knowledge Compounding**: Each interaction enhances future creative capacity
